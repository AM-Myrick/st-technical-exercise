This is a simple CLI for a reimbursement calculator which follows the rules given for Simple Thread's technical exercise.

This was written using Bun as a runtime and package manager, please install it globally with `npm i -g bun` if you don't already have it installed and then enter `bun install` to download dependencies.

The example sets of projects can have their results generated by entering `bun set[#]` or `bun allSets` in your terminal.

Custom sets of projects can have their reimbursement amount calculated by using this pattern in your terminal `bun run [-cost] [start] [end]`.

ex. `bun run -l 9/1/15 9/1/15` calculates the reimbursement amount for a single day in a low cost city.

ex. `bun run -l 9/1/15 9/1/15 -h 9/2/15 9/2/15` calculates the reimbursement amount for two days, one in a low cost city and another in a high cost city.

ex. `bun run -l 9/1/15 9/3/15 -h 9/5/15 9/6/15` calculates the reimbursement amount for two projects with a gap in between.
